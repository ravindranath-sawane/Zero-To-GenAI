    "\n",
    "**Discriminative AI** is like a **judge at a dog show**. It looks at something and decides which category it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Classification, prediction, detection\n",
    "- **Example**: \"Is this a cat or a dog?\" → \"It's a cat!\"\n",
    "- **How it works**: Learns the *boundaries* between different categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a spam filter that looks at an email and decides: **Spam** or **Not Spam**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Generative AI (The New Wave)\n",

    "**Generative AI** is like an **artist**. Instead of just judging things, it *creates* new things that never existed before!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Creation, generation, synthesis\n",
    "- **Example**: \"Create a picture of a cat wearing a space suit\" → 🐱🚀\n",
    "- **How it works**: Learns the *patterns* of data so well that it can create new, similar data\n",

    "## 2. How LLMs Work: Next Token Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📱 Autocomplete on Steroids!\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever typed a text message and your phone suggested the next word? That's basically what Large Language Models (LLMs) do, but **much, much smarter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea: Next Token Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained to predict **\"What word (or token) comes next?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"The cat sat on the\"\n",
    "LLM predicts: \"mat\" (or \"floor\", \"chair\", \"roof\", etc.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 But How Is This So Powerful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the magic: When you train a model to predict the next word on **trillions of words** from books, websites, and articles, it has to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grammar** - to make sentences flow correctly\n",
    "2. **Facts** - \"Paris is the capital of...\" → \"France\"\n",
    "3. **Reasoning** - to connect ideas logically\n",
    "4. **Context** - to understand what the conversation is about\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 The Generation Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask ChatGPT a question, here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM thinks: \"What is the capital of France?\" → predicts \"The\"\n",
    "LLM thinks: \"What is the capital of France? The\" → predicts \"capital\"\n",
    "LLM thinks: \"What is the capital of France? The capital\" → predicts \"of\"\n",
    "... and so on until it predicts a stop signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Final output: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Key Insight**: LLMs don't \"know\" things the way humans do. They're incredibly sophisticated pattern matchers that have seen so much text that they can generate coherent, useful responses."

    "\n",
    "**Tokens are NOT the same as words!**\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is a chunk of text that the model processes. It could be:\n",
    "- A whole word: `hello` → 1 token\n",
    "- Part of a word: `uncomfortable` → `un` + `comfort` + `able` = 3 tokens\n",
    "- Punctuation: `!` → 1 token\n",
    "- A space + word combination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Tokens Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost**: API pricing is often based on tokens (e.g., $0.01 per 1,000 tokens)\n",
    "2. **Limits**: Models have maximum token limits (context window)\n",
    "3. **Speed**: More tokens = slower processing\n",
    "\n",
