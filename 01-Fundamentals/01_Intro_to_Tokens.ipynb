    "\n",
    "Before we dive into tokens, let's quickly understand the two main types of AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Discriminative AI\n",
    "**\"What category does this belong to?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acts like a **judge** or **classifier**\n",
    "- Examples: Spam detection, image classification, fraud detection\n",
    "- Input: Data → Output: Label/Category\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Generative AI\n",
    "**\"Create something new that looks like the training data\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acts like an **artist** or **creator**\n",
    "- Examples: ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Claude\n",
    "- Input: Prompt → Output: New content (text, images, code)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **The Magic**: Generative AI learns patterns so well that it can create entirely new content that never existed before!"

    "## 📱 How LLMs Work: Next Token Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Smartphone Autocomplete Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "You know how your phone suggests the next word when you're typing a message?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You type: \"I'll meet you at the\"\n",
    "Phone suggests: [coffee] [park] [office]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Models (LLMs) work exactly like this — but on steroids!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LLMs are trained on **trillions of words** from the internet\n",
    "2. They learn to predict: **\"What comes next?\"**\n",
    "3. Generation happens **one token at a time** in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"The capital of France is\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Predict next token → \"Paris\"\n",
    "Step 2: Predict next token → \".\"\n",
    "Step 3: Predict next token → [STOP]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"Paris.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This So Powerful?\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the next word accurately, the model **must learn**:\n",
    "- ✅ Grammar and syntax\n",
    "- ✅ Facts and knowledge\n",
    "- ✅ Reasoning and logic\n",
    "- ✅ Context and relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Key Insight**: The simple task of \"predict the next token\" forces the model to learn an incredible amount about language and the world!"

    "\n",
    "### Tokens ≠ Words!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most important concepts to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A token is a chunk of text that the model processes.** It could be:\n",
    "- A whole word: `hello` → 1 token\n",
    "- Part of a word: `hamburger` → `ham` + `burger` = 2 tokens\n",
    "- A single character: `!` → 1 token\n",
    "- A space: ` ` → often combined with the next word\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tokens Instead of Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Common words = 1 token, rare words = multiple tokens\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: Can handle any language, code, or special characters\n",
    "3. **Vocabulary Size**: Limited vocabulary (~50,000-100,000 tokens) can represent infinite text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Tokens Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Reason | Impact |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| **Cost** | API pricing is per token ($X per 1M tokens) |\n",
